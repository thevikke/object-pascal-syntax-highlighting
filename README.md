# Pascal Language Basics

This extension provides syntax highlighting for Object Pascal code. It is built upon an existing extension: [Pascal Language Basics](https://github.com/AnsonYeung/vscode-pascal-language-basics). Pascal Language Basics does not support Object Pascal, therefore we decided to fork it and add the necessary support in this extension.
